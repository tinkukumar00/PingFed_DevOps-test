# Introduction
This section outlines ways to easily deploy Ping products with pre-defined configurations.  After you have successfully deployed using this example, you can try other provided examples or move on to customizing the products to fit your needs and environment.

You will need to [register for the Ping DevOps program](../how-to/devopsRegistration.md) in order to obtain trial licenses for evaluating or testing with our products.

After registering at the link above, you will be provided a username and key.  These credentials provide a temporary license for your evaluation.  See [using your DevOps User and Key](../how-to/devopsUserKey.md) for instructions on use.

Finally, to manage PingOne resources using credentials other than your own, you are required to have a PingOne Worker App. See [this configuration page](../reference/pingone-config.md) for more details on configuration.
